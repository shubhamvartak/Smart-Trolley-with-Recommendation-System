# Smart-Trolley-with-Recommendation-System
This Project is a blend of IoT and Machine Learning to make shopping hassle-free with a recommendation of products to customers as the icing on the cake! 
Working:
First, the customer is supposed to scan to products which he/she wants to buy. These entries are instantaneously updated in an excel sheet and displayed on the LCD screen. Furthermore, the excel sheet is used as a dataset to perform recommendations for the buyer using Apriori Algorithm.

Arduino Uno
RFID Reader
RDIF Tags
Buzzer
LED
LCD Display
Jumper Cables
Bread Board

Software Requirements:
